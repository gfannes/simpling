simpling
========

*simpling* is a simulation and sampling library, primarily targeted towards Bayesian calculations.

== Overview

Our initial goal is to provide generic and reusable implementations of some of the available Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. These algorithms allow the user to sample from a probability distribution of interest, typically the a posteriori distribution over the model parameters. Such sampling machinery can be used for numerical computation of an integral, a common task in Bayesian statistics.

== Algorithms

* Metropolis-Hastings MCMC
* Hybrid MCMC
* Reversible jump MCMC
* Langevin MCMC
* Metropolis Coupled MCMC
* Missing Completed Metropolis Coupled MCMC

== Development

*simpling* only depends on the ##C++11## standard, and should compile with common compilers like http://gcc.gnu.org/[gcc], msvc or http://clang.llvm.org/[clang].
The code aims to be as generic as possible.

For testing purposes, https://github.com/philsquared/Catch seems reasonable.
